<h1 align="center">‚ú®THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE OF CYBER THREATS‚ú®</h1>
<h5 align="center">"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." - Carl Sagan</h5>
<p align="center">Security programs are responsible for keeping up with and getting ahead of the rapid growth of cyber threats. Enterprise organizations must monitor for changes in threat actor TTPs, keep track of emerging vulnerabilities, assess gaps related to technological advances that outpace security solutions, and the list goes on. A solution that some organizations are deploying to help manage the expanding threat landscape is cyber threat intelligence. Some enterprise security teams rely on cyber threat intelligence to: prioritize and provide context to threats, dispel FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), and share actionable, relevant, timely, and accurate insights with decision-makers. Join me in exploring cyber threat intelligence and the expanding universe of cyber threats.</p>
